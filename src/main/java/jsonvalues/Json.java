/**
 <pre>
 Represents a json of type T, where T is the type of the container, either a JsObj or a JsArray.

 A json of any type can be modeled as a set of pairs {@link JsPair}=({@link JsPath}, {@link JsElem}), where:

 - a JsElem is a {@link JsBool} or {@link JsStr} or {@link JsNumber} or {@link JsNull}, or another {@link Json} like {@link JsObj} or {@link JsArray},
 what makes the data structure recursive.

 - a JsPath represents the location of the element in the json.

 For example, the json
 {
 "a":1, "x":{ "c": true, "d":null, e: [false, 1, "hi"] }
 }

 can be seen as the following set:

 Set[(a,1), (x.c,true), (x.d,null), (x.e.0,false), (x.e.1,1), (x.e.2,"hi"), (_,NOTHING)]

 where _, which means any other JsPath, and the special element {@link JsNothing#NOTHING}, makes the
 function {@link #get(JsPath)} total (defined for every possible path). Moreover, inserting JsNothing
 in a json doesn't change the json, which is very convenient when passing functions as parameters to
 put data in:

 //all the logic goes into the supplier{@code
Supplier<JsElem> supplier = ()-> (doesnt-put-anything-condition) ? JsNothing.NOTHING : JsInt.of(2);
json.putIfAbsent(path,supplier)
}
 Another way to see a json is like a stream of pairs, which opens the door to doing all the operations
 that were introduced in Java 8 (map, filter, reduce, etc). For this purpose the methods {@link #stream_()}
 or {@link #stream()} are provided. To put the stream back into an <b>immutable</b> json the collectors {@link JsObj#collector()}
 and {@link JsArray#collector()} can be used, whereas the collectors {@link JsObj#_collector_()} and {@link JsArray#_collector_()}
 would put the stream back into a <b>mutable</b> json.

 All the methods that accept a {@link JsPath} are overloaded and accept also a path-like string instead.

 There are two types of conventions on method names:

 -Static factory methods that are prefixed and suffixed with underscore return mutable instances.
 -Methods that are suffixed with underscore traverse the whole json recursively.

 All the methods throw a NullPointerException when any of the params passed in is null. The exception
 <code>UserError</code> is thrown when the user calls a method inappropriately:
 for example calling the method <code>asJsStr</code> in a <code>JsNull</code> instance or calling the
 method head in an empty array, etc. Normally, when that happens, a previous check is missing.
