## <a name="introduction"><a/> Introduction
Welcome to **json-values**, the first-ever Json library in _Java_ implemented with persistent data structures.

One of the most essential aspects of functional programming is immutable data structures, better known as values. Updating these structures using the copy-on-write approach is inefficient, and this is why persistent
data structures were created. On the other hand, JSON is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format. It's become so popular due to its simplicity.

There are many libraries out there to work with JSON in the JVM ecosystem; however, none of them use persistent data structures. In most cases, those libraries parse a string or array of bytes into an object. The thing is, why do that? JSON is a magnificent structure.
It's simple, easy to aggregate, ease to create, easy to reason about, so why create yet another abstraction over JSON? Moreover, many architectures work with JSON end-to-end. Going from JSON to objects or strings back and forth is not
efficient, especially when copy-on-write is the only option to avoid mutation.

## <a name="whatfor"><a/> What to use json-values for and when to use it
* You need to deal with Jsons, and you want to program following a functional style, **using functions and immutable types (or values)**,
but you can't benefit from all the advantage that immutability brings to your code because **Java doesn't provide Persistent Data Structures**.
The thing is that Java 8 brought functions, lambdas, lazy evaluation to some extent, and streams, but without immutability,
something is still missing, and as _**Pat Helland**_ said, [Immutability Changes Everything!](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf)
* You manipulate Jsons all the time, and you'd like to do it with less ceremony. **json-values** is declarative and takes advantages of all the features that were introduced
in Java 8, like functions, suppliers, streams, and collectors, making json manipulation simple, fast, and efficient.
* Simplicity matters, and I 'd argue that **json-values** is simple.
* As a developer, I'm convinced that code should win arguments, so let me enumerate some examples, where I
leave the functions passed in as arguments with no implementation for brevity reasons. 

```
json.mapKeys(toSneakeCase)

json.mapValues(trim, ifStr)

json.filterKeys(key.startsWith("_field"))

json.filterValues(isNotNull)

json.reduce(plus, ifInt)

//RFC 6901
json.set(path("/a/b"), value)

a.union(b, JsArray.TYPE.SET)
a.union(b, JsArray.TYPE.LIST)
a.union(b, JsArray.TYPE.MULTISET)

a.intersection(b)
```
I'd argue that it's straightforward, expressive, and concise. And that plus the fact that it's a persistent
data structure shows very well the essence of **json-values**.

That was just a little taste! Data generation and validation are significant in software.
If you think about it, the definition, validation, and generation of a JSON could be
implemented using the same data structure; after all, the three of them are just bindings with different
elements: values, generators, or specifications. Let's check out some examples.

Defining a json object:

```
var person = JsObj.of("name", JsStr.of("Rafael"),
                      "age", JsInt.of(37),
                      "languages", JsArray.of("Haskell", "Scala", "Java", "Clojure")
                      "github", JsStr.of("imrafaelmerino"),
                      "profession", JsStr.of("frustrated consultant"),
                      "address", JsObj.of("city", JsStr.of("Madrid"),
                                          "location", JsArray.of(40.566, 87.987),
                                          "country",JsStr.of("ES").optional().nullable()
                                          )
                        );

```

Defining a json spec; strict means: keys different from the specified are not allowed:

```
import static jsonvalues.spec.JsSpecs;

var addressSpec=JsObjSpec.lenient("city", str,
                                  "country",str.optional().nullable()
                                  "location", tuple(decimal,
                                                    decimal
                                                   )
                                 );

var spec = JsObjSpec.strict("name", str,
                            "age", integer(n-> n>15 && n<100),
                            "languages", arrayOfStr,
                            "github", str.optional(),
                            "profession", str.nullable(),
                            "address", addressSpec
                           );

// if the object doesn't conform the spec, the errors and their locations are returned in a set

Set<JsErrorPair> errors = spec.test(person);

```

We can use a spec to parse a string! As soon as an error is found, the parsing ends.

```

byte[] jsonBytes = ...;
String jsonStr = ...;

var parser = new JsObjParser(spec);

var a = parser.parse(jsonBytes);
var b = parser.parse(jsonStr);

```

Defining a json generator:

```
import static jsonvalues.gen.JsGens;

var addressGen = JsObjGen.of("city", oneOf(cities),
                             "country",oneOf(countries).optional().nullable(),
                             "location", tuple(decimal,
                                               decimal
                                               )
                            );
var gen = JsObjGen.of("name", alphabetic,
                      "age",  choose(18,100),
                      "languages", arrayOf(str,10),
                      "github", alphanumeric.optional(),
                      "profession", oneOf(professions).nullable(),
                      "address", addressGen
                     );

```

Defining a future following the same philosophy:

```
CompletableFuture<JsValue> nameFut, ageFut, languagesFut,handleFut,;
CompletableFuture<JsValue> professionFut, streetFut, lonFut, latFut, countryFut;

var future = JsObjFuture.of("name", () -> nameFut,
                            "age", () -> ageFut,
                            "languages", () -> languagesFut,
                            "github", () -> handleFut,
                            "profession", () -> professionFut,
                            "address", JsObjFuture.of("street", streetFut,
                                                      "location", tuple(() -> latFut,
                                                                        () -> lonFut
                                                                       ),
                                                      "country", () -> countryFut
                                                      )
                            );

CompletableFuture<JsObj> completableFuture = future.get();

```

We can even create suppliers:

```

Supplier<JsValue> name, age, languages, handle;
Supplier<JsValue> profession, street, lon, lat, country;

var supplier = JsObjSupplier.of("name", name,
                                "age", age,
                                "languages", languages,
                                "github", handle,
                                "profession", profession,
                                "address", JsObjFuture.of("street", street,
                                                          "location", tuple(lat,
                                                                            lon
                                                                           ),
                                                          "country", country
                                                          )
                                );

JsObj obj = supplier.get();

```

It supports the standard Json types: string, number, null, object, array; There are five number especializations:
int, long, double, decimal and biginteger. json-values adds support for instants and binary data. Instants 
are serialized into its string representation according to ISO-8601; and the binary type is serialized into a 
string encoded in base 64.

I've written about json-values on my [blog](http://blog.imrafaelmerino.dev):
* [The value of json values - Recursive data structures](http://blog.imrafaelmerino.dev/2020/06/the-value-of-json-values-recursive-data.html)
* [The value of json values - Optics](https://blog.imrafaelmerino.dev/2020/06/the-value-of-json-values-optics.html)

## <a name="notwhatfor"><a/> When not to use it
**json-values** fits well in _pure_ OOP and incredibly well in FP, but NOT in _EOOP_, which stands for
Enterprise Object-Oriented Programming. Don't create yet another fancy abstraction with getters and setters
or a complex DSL over json-values. [Narcissistic Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEZv-kQUSi4) from **Stuart Halloway** is a
great talk that elaborates ironically on this point.

After the development of json-values, I published two more related projects:
* The Scala version: [json-scala-values](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/json-scala-values)
* Json generators in Scala to do property-based testing: [json-scala-values-generator](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/json-scala-values-generator) . This is a
project I'm especially proud of. I think there is no Json generator more declarative, concise, and why not, beautiful in the
whole wide world! If I'm wrong, please let me know!

json-values uses the persistent data structures from [vavr](https://www.vavr.io/), [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) to parse a string/bytes into
a stream of tokens and [dsl-sjon](https://github.com/ngs-doo/dsl-json) to parse a string/bytes given a spec.
