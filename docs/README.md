## <a name="introduction"><a/> Introduction

Welcome to **json-values**, the first-ever Json library in _Java_ implemented with persistent data structures.

One of the most essential aspects of functional programming is immutable data structures, better known as values.
Updating these structures using the copy-on-write approach is inefficient, and this is why persistent
data structures were created. 

There are many libraries out there to work with JSON in the JVM ecosystem; however, none of them use persistent data
structures. In most cases, those libraries parse a string or array of bytes into an object. The thing is, why do that?
JSON is a magnificent structure. It's simple, easy to aggregate, ease to create, easy to reason about, so why create
yet another abstraction over JSON? Moreover, many architectures work with JSON end-to-end. Going from JSON to objects
or strings back and forth is not efficient, especially when copy-on-write is the only option to avoid mutation.

## <a name="whatfor"><a/> What to use json-values for and when to use it

* You need to deal with Jsons, and you want to program following a functional style, **using just functions and values**
  ,
  but you can't benefit from all the advantage that immutability brings to your code because **Java doesn't provide
  Persistent Data Structures**.
  The thing is that Java 8 brought functions, lambdas, lazy evaluation to some extent, and streams, but without
  immutability,
  something is still missing, and as _**Pat Helland**_
  said, [Immutability Changes Everything!](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf)
* You manipulate Jsons all the time, and you'd like to do it with less ceremony. **json-values** is declarative and
  takes advantage of a lot of concepts from functional programming to define a powerful API.
* Generating Json to do Property-Based-Testing is child's play with json-values.
* Generation specifications to validate Json and parse strings or bytes is a piece of cake.
* Simplicity matters, and I'd argue that **json-values** is simple.
* As a developer, I'm convinced that code should win arguments, so let me enumerate some examples.

First things first. Let's define a Json

```json
{
    "name": "Rafael",
    "surname": "Merino",
    "phoneNumber": 6666666,
    "registrationDate": "2019-01-21T05:47:26.853Z",
    "addresses": [
         {
            "coordinates": [39.8581, -4.02263],
            "city": "Toledo",
            "zipCode": "45920", 
            "tags": ["homeAddress"] ,
             
        },
        {
            "coordinates": [39.8581, -4.02263],
            "city": "Madrid",
            "zipCode": "28029",
            "tags": ["workAddress"]
        }
    ]
}

```

and coding it using the factory methods provided by json-values

```java      
import jsonvalues.*;  

JsObj.of("name", JsStr.of("Rafael"),
         "surname", JsStr.of("Merino"),
         "phoneNumber", JsStr.of("6666666"),
         "registrationDate", JsInstant.of(Instant.parse("2019-01-21T05:47:26.853Z")),
         "addresses", JsArray.of(JsObj.of("coordinates", JsArray.of(39.8581, -4.02263),
                                          "city", JsStr.of("Toledo"),
                                          "zipCode", JsString.of("45920"),
                                          "tags", JsArray.of("workAddress")
                                         ),
                                 JsObj.of("coordinates", JsArray.of(39.8581, -4.02263),
                                          "city", JsStr.of("Madrid"),
                                          "zipCode", JsString.of("28029"),
                                          "tags", JsArray.of("homeAddress", "amazon")
                                         )
                                )
        );

```

As you can see, the final structure is very similar to the original Json, what makes
really easy to write out any imaginable Json just putting its keys and their
associated values. You can create up to 20-field Json objects using this approach. 
For bigger Jsons exits the *set* method

```java  

JsObj.empty()
     .set("name", JsStr.of("Rafael"));

```

It's dime a dozen to have to validate Json. Why don't use
a similar approach? I mean, after all, a Json spec looks like a
Json, a set of keys and their specifications... Let's do it!

```java   
import jsonvalues.spec.JsObjSpec;
import static jsonvalues.spec.JsSpecs.*;

JsObjSpec.strict("name", str(),
                 "surname", str(),
                 "phoneNumber", str(),
                 "registrationDate", instant(),
                 "addresses", arrayOfObjSpec(JsObjSpec.strict("coordinates", tuple(decimal(),
                                                                                   decimal()
                                                                                  ),
                                                              "city", str(),
                                                              "tags", arrayOfStr(),
                                                              "zipCode", str()
                                                              )
                                            )
                );

```

And we can pass in predicates to be more specific about the
possible values a field can have

```java    

BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Predicate<String>> lengthBetween =
       (min, max) -> string -> string.length() <= max && 
                               string.length() >= min;


BiFunction<Instant, Instant, Predicate<Instant>> instantBetween =
      (min, max) -> instant -> min.isBefore(instant) && 
                               max.isAfter(instant);

BiFunction<Long, Long, Predicate<BigDecimal>> decBetween =
      (min, max) -> n -> BigDecimal.valueOf(min).compareTo(n) < 0 && 
                         BigDecimal.valueOf(max).compareTo(n) > 0;
  
```

```java    

int MAX_NAME_LENGTH = 10;
int MAX_SURNAME_LENGTH = 10;
int MAX_PHONE_LENGTH = 10;
int MAX_CITY_LENGTH = 20;
int MAX_TAG_LENGTH = 20;
int MAX_ZIPCODE_LENGTH = 30;
        
Predicate<String> nameSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_NAME_LENGTH);
       
Predicate<String> surnameSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_SURNAME_LENGTH);
        
Predicate<String> phoneSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_PHONE_LENGTH);
        
Predicate<Instant> registrationDateSpec = instantBetween.apply(Instant.EPOCH, Instant.MAX);

Predicate<BigDecimal> latitudeSpec = decBetween.apply(-90L, 90L);

Predicate<BigDecimal> longitudeSpec = decBetween.apply(-180L, 180L);

Predicate<String> citySpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_CITY_LENGTH);
        
Predicate<String> tagSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_TAG_LENGTH);
       
Predicate<String> zipCodeSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_ZIPCODE_LENGTH);
        

```

```java    

JsObjSpec.strict("name", str(nameSpec),
                 "surname", str(surnameSpec),
                 "phoneNumber", str(phoneSpec),
                 "registrationDate", instant(registrationDateSpec),
                 "addresses", arrayOfObjSpec(JsObjSpec.strict("coordinates",
                                                               tuple(decimal(latitudeSpec),
                                                                     decimal(longitudeSpec)
                                                                    ),
                                                               "city", str(citySpec),
                                                               "tags", arrayOfStr(tagSpec),
                                                               "zipCode", str(zipCodeSpec)
                                                              )
                                                      .setOptionals("tags", "zipCode", "city")
                                             )
                )
        .setOptionals("surname", "phoneNumber", "addresses");

```

And what about generating a Json? You are right! We can use the
same data structure made up of keys and their
associated generators. I hope you weren't considering piling up
annotations. Rumor has it that some guy got a StackOverflowException!


```java      


JsObjGen.of("name", JsStrGen.biased(0, MAX_NAME_LENGTH + 1),
            "surname", JsStrGen.biased(0, MAX_NAME_SURNAME + 1),
            "phoneNumber", JsStrGen.biased(0,MAX_PHONE_LENGTH + 1),
            "registrationDate", JsInstantGen.biased(0, Instant.MAX.getEpochSecond()),
            "addresses", JsArrayGen.biased(0,1)
                                   .apply(JsObjGen.of("coordinates", 
                                                      JsTupleGen.of(JsBigDecGen.biased(-90,90),
                                                                    JsBigDecGen.biased(-180,180)
                                                                   ),
                                                      "city", JsStrGen.biased(0,100),
                                                      "tags", JsArrayGen.biased(0,100)
                                                                        .apply(JsStrGen.biased(0,20)),
                                                      "zipCode", JsStrGen.biased(0,10)
                                                     )
                                                   .setOptionals("tags", "zipCode", "city")
                                          )
            )
        .setOptionals("surname", "phoneNumber", "addresses");

```

```java 
//FILTERING
todo


JsObj json = JsObj.parse(string)

// first level         
json.mapKeys(toSneakeCase)

// traverses first level and  nested json       
json.mapAllKeys(toSneakeCase)

json.mapAllValues(trim, ifStr)

json.filterAllKeys(key.startsWith("_field"))

json.filterAllValues(isNotNull)

json.reduceAll(plus, ifInt)

//RFC 6901
json.set(path("/a/b"), value)

a.union(b, JsArray.TYPE.SET)
a.union(b, JsArray.TYPE.LIST)
a.union(b, JsArray.TYPE.MULTISET)

a.intersection(b)
```

I'd argue that it's straightforward, expressive, and concise. And that plus the fact that it's a persistent
data structure shows very well the essence of **json-values**.

That was just a little taste! Data generation and validation are significant in software.
If you think about it, the definition, validation, and generation of a JSON could be
implemented using the same data structure; after all, the three of them are just bindings with different
elements: values, generators, or specifications. Let's check out some examples.

Defining a json object:

```java
var person=JsObj.of("name",JsStr.of("Rafael"),
        "age",JsInt.of(37),
        "languages",JsArray.of("Haskell","Scala","Java","Clojure")
        "github",JsStr.of("imrafaelmerino"),
        "profession",JsStr.of("frustrated consultant"),
        "address",JsObj.of("city",JsStr.of("Madrid"),
        "location",JsArray.of(40.566,87.987),
        "country",JsStr.of("ES")
        )
        );

```

Defining a json spec; strict means: keys different from the specified are not allowed:

```java
import static jsonvalues.spec.JsSpecs;

var addressSpec=JsObjSpec.lenient("city",str,
        "country",str.optional().nullable()
        "location",tuple(decimal,
        decimal
        )
        );

        var spec=JsObjSpec.strict("name",str,
        "age",integer(n->n>15&&n<100),
        "languages",arrayOfStr,
        "github",str.optional(),
        "profession",str.nullable(),
        "address",addressSpec
        );

// if the object doesn't conform the spec, the errors and their locations are returned in a set

        Set<JsErrorPair> errors=spec.test(person);

```

We can use a spec to parse a string! As soon as an error is found, the parsing ends.

```java

byte[]jsonBytes=...;
        String jsonStr=...;

        var parser=new JsObjParser(spec);

        var a=parser.parse(jsonBytes);
        var b=parser.parse(jsonStr);

```

It supports the standard Json types: string, number, null, object, array; There are five number specializations:
int, long, double, decimal and biginteger. json-values adds support for instants and binary data. Instants
are serialized into its string representation according to ISO-8601; and the binary type is serialized into a
string encoded in base 64.

## <a name="notwhatfor"><a/> When not to use it

**json-values** fits well in _pure_ OOP and incredibly well in FP, but NOT in _EOOP_, which stands for
Enterprise Object-Oriented Programming. Don't create yet another fancy abstraction with getters and setters
or a complex DSL over json-values. [Narcissistic Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEZv-kQUSi4) from **Stuart
Halloway** is a
great talk that elaborates ironically on this point.

After the development of json-values, I published two more related projects:

* The Scala version: [json-scala-values](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/json-scala-values)
* [vertx-effect](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/vertx-effect)
* [mongo-values](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/mongo-values) Set of codecs to use json-values with MongoDB
* [JIO](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/JIO) Using JIO you can define Json generators to do Property Based Testing:

```java
import static jio.gen.json.JsObjGen;

var addressGen=JsObjGen.of("city",oneOf(cities),
        "country",oneOf(countries).nullable(),
        "location",tuple(decimal,
        decimal
        )
        );
        var gen=JsObjGen.of("name",alphabetic,
        "age",arbitrary(18,100),
        "languages",arrayOf(str,10),
        "github",alphanumeric,
        "profession",oneOf(professions).nullable(),
        "address",addressGen
        );
```

json-values uses the persistent data structures from [vavr](https://www.vavr.io/)
, [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) to parse a string/bytes into
a stream of tokens and [dsl-sjon](https://github.com/ngs-doo/dsl-json) to parse a string/bytes given a spec.

## <a name="release"><a/> Release process

Every time a tagged commit is pushed into master, a Travis CI build will be triggered automatically and start the
release process,
deploying to Maven repositories and GitHub Releases. See the Travis conf file .travis.yml for
further details. On the other hand, the master branch is read-only, and all the commits should be pushed to
master through pull requests.
