## <a name="introduction"><a/> Introduction

Welcome to **json-values**, the first-ever Json library in _Java_ implemented with
persistent data structures.

One of the most essential aspects of functional programming is immutable data structures,
better known in FP jargon as values.
It's a fact that, when possible, working with values leads to code with fewer bugs, is more
readable, and is easier to maintain. Item 17 of Effective Java states that we must minimize
mutability. Still, sometimes it's at the cost of losing performance because the 
[copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write)
approach is very inefficient for significant data structures. Here is where persistent data
structures come into play.

Most functional languages, like Haskell, Clojure, and Scala, implement persistent data
structures natively. Java doesn't. 

The standard Java programmer finds it strange to work without objects and all the machinery
of frameworks and annotations. FP is all about functions and values; that's it. I will try
to cast some light on how we can manipulate JSON with json-values following a purely
functional approach.

json-values supports the standard Json types: string, number, null, object, array; There 
are five number specializations: int, long, double, decimal and biginteger. json-values 
adds support for instants and binary data. Instants are serialized into its string 
representation according to ISO-8601; and the binary type is serialized into a string 
encoded in base 64.

## <a name="whatfor"><a/> What to use json-values for and when to use it

* You need to deal with Jsons, and you want to program following a functional style, **using just functions and values**,
  but you can't benefit from all the advantage that immutability brings to your code because **Java doesn't provide
  [Persistent Data Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure)**.
  The thing is that Java 8 brought functions, lambdas, lazy evaluation to some extent, and streams, but without
  immutability, something is still missing, and as _**Pat Helland**_
  said, [Immutability Changes Everything!](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf)
* You manipulate Json all the time, and you'd like to do it with less ceremony. **json-values** is declarative and
  takes advantage of a lot of concepts from functional programming to define a powerful API.
* Generating Json to do Property-Based-Testing is child's play with json-values.
* Generating specifications to validate Json and parse strings or bytes very efficiently is a piece of cake.
* Simplicity matters, and I'd argue that **json-values** is simple.

## <a name="examples"><a/> Examples

As a developer, I'm convinced that code should win arguments, so let's get down to business.
First things first. Let's create the following JSON

```json
{
    "name": "Rafael",
    "surname": "Merino",
    "phoneNumber": 6666666,
    "registrationDate": "2019-01-21T05:47:26.853Z",
    "addresses": [
        {
            "coordinates": [39.8581, -4.02263],
            "city": "Toledo",
            "zipCode": "45920",
            "tags": ["homeAddress"]
        },
        {
            "coordinates": [39.8581, -4.02263],
            "city": "Madrid",
            "zipCode": "28029",
            "tags": ["workAddress"]
        }
    ]
}

```

using the static factory methods provided by json-values

```java      
import jsonvalues.*;
import java.time.Instant;

JsObj person = 
    JsObj.of("name", JsStr.of("Rafael"),
             "surname", JsStr.of("Merino"),
             "phoneNumber", JsStr.of("6666666"),
             "registrationDate", JsInstant.of("2019-01-21T05:47:26.853Z"),
             "addresses", JsArray.of(JsObj.of("coordinates", JsArray.of(39.8581, -4.02263),
                                              "city", JsStr.of("Toledo"),
                                              "zipCode", JsStr.of("45920"),
                                              "tags", JsArray.of("workAddress")
                                             ),
                                     JsObj.of("coordinates", JsArray.of(40.4168, 3.7038),
                                              "city", JsStr.of("Madrid"),
                                              "zipCode", JsStr.of("28029"),
                                              "tags", JsArray.of("homeAddress", "amazon")
                                             )
                                    )
            );
```

As you can see, its definition is like raw JSON. It’s a recursive data structure.
You can nest as many JSON objects as you want. Think of any imaginable JSON, and
you can write it in no time.

But what about validating JSON? We can define the JSON schema following precisely
the same approach:

```java   
import static jsonvalues.spec.JsSpecs.*;
import jsonvalues.spec.JsObjSpec;
import jsonvalues.spec.JsErrorPair;

JsObjSpec personSpec =
    JsObjSpec.strict("name", str(),
                     "surname", str(),
                     "phoneNumber", str(),
                     "registrationDate", instant(),
                     "addresses", arrayOfObjSpec(JsObjSpec.strict("coordinates", 
                                                                  tuple(decimal(),
                                                                        decimal()
                                                                        ),
                                                                  "city", str(),
                                                                  "tags", arrayOfStr(),
                                                                  "zipCode", str()
                                                                  )
                                                )
                    );
    
Set<JsErrorPair> errors = personSepc.test(person);   

Function<JsErrorPair, String> toStr = 
    pair -> pair.error.value + " @ "+ pair.path + " doesn't conform spec: " + pair.error.code;   

errors.forEach(pair -> System.out.println(toStr.apply(pair)));
    
    
```

I’d argue that it is very expressive, concise, and straightforward. I call it json-spec.
I named it after a Clojure library named [spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec). Writing 
specs feels like writing JSON. Strict specs don't allow keys that are not specified, whereas 
lenient ones do. The real power is that you can create specs from predicates and compose them:

```java   
import static jsonvalues.spec.JsSpecs.*;    
import jsonvalues.spec.JsObjSpec;
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.function.*;

BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Predicate<String>> lengthBetween =
       (min, max) -> string -> string.length() <= max && 
                               string.length() >= min;

BiFunction<Instant, Instant, Predicate<Instant>> instantBetween =
      (min, max) -> instant -> min.isBefore(instant) && 
                               max.isAfter(instant);

BiFunction<Long, Long, Predicate<BigDecimal>> decBetween =
      (min, max) -> n -> BigDecimal.valueOf(min).compareTo(n) < 0 && 
                         BigDecimal.valueOf(max).compareTo(n) > 0;
  
int MAX_NAME_LENGTH = 10;
int MAX_SURNAME_LENGTH = 10;
int MAX_PHONE_LENGTH = 10;
int MAX_CITY_LENGTH = 20;
int MAX_TAG_LENGTH = 20;
int MAX_ZIPCODE_LENGTH = 30;
int MIN_ADDRESSES_SIZE = 1;
int MAX_ADDRESSES_SIZE = 100;
int MAX_TAGS_SIZE = 10;
long LAT_MIN = -90;
long LAT_MAX = 90;
long LON_MIN = -180;
long LON_MAX = 180;    

       
Predicate<String> nameSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_NAME_LENGTH);
       
Predicate<String> surnameSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_SURNAME_LENGTH);
        
Predicate<String> phoneSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_PHONE_LENGTH);
        
Predicate<Instant> registrationDateSpec = instantBetween.apply(Instant.EPOCH, Instant.MAX);

Predicate<BigDecimal> latitudeSpec = decBetween.apply(LAT_MIN, LAT_MAX);

Predicate<BigDecimal> longitudeSpec = decBetween.apply(LON_MIN, LON_MAX);

Predicate<String> citySpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_CITY_LENGTH);
        
Predicate<String> tagSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_TAG_LENGTH);
       
Predicate<String> zipCodeSpec = lengthBetween.apply(0, MAX_ZIPCODE_LENGTH);
        

JsObjSpec personSpec =
    JsObjSpec.strict("name", str(nameSpec),
                     "surname", str(surnameSpec),
                     "phoneNumber", str(phoneSpec).nullable(),
                     "registrationDate", instant(registrationDateSpec),
                     "addresses", 
                     arrayOfObjSpec(JsObjSpec.lenient("coordinates",
                                                      tuple(decimal(latitudeSpec),
                                                            decimal(longitudeSpec)
                                                           ),
                                                      "city", str(citySpec),
                                                      "tags", arrayOfStr(tagSpec,
                                                                         0,
                                                                         MAX_TAGS_SIZE
                                                                        ),
                                                      "zipCode", str(zipCodeSpec)
                                                     )
                                             .setOptionals("tags", "zipCode", "city"),
                                    MIN_ADDRESSES_SIZE,
                                    MAX_ADDRESSES_SIZE                
                                    )
                     )
             .setOptionals("surname", "phoneNumber", "addresses");   
    
```

As you can see, the spec's structure remains the same, and it’s child’s play to define
optional and nullable fields.

Another exciting thing we can do with specs is parsing strings or bytes. Instead of parsing
the whole Json and then validating it, we can verify the schema while parsing it and
stop the process as soon as an error happens. After all, failing fast is important as well!

```java      
import com.dslplatform.json.JsParserException;
import jsonvalues.spec.JsObjParser;    

JsObjParser personParser = new JsObjParser(personSpec);

String string = "...";
    
try{

    JsObj person = personParser.parse(string);
    
   }
catch(JsParserException e){
    
    System.out.println("Error parsing person JSON: " + e.getMessage())
    
}    

```

Another critical aspect of software development is data generation. It’s an essential aspect
of property-based testing, a technique for the random testing of program properties very well
known in FP. Computers are way better than humans at generating random data. You'll catch more
bugs testing your code against a lot of inputs instead of just one. Writing generators, like
specs, is as simple as writing Json:

```java      

JsObjGen personGen =
  JsObjGen.of("name", JsStrGen.biased(0, MAX_NAME_LENGTH),
              "surname", JsStrGen.biased(0, MAX_NAME_LENGTH),
              "phoneNumber", JsStrGen.biased(0,MAX_PHONE_LENGTH),
              "registrationDate", JsInstantGen.biased(0, Instant.MAX.getEpochSecond()),
              "addresses", 
              JsArrayGen.biased(JsObjGen.of("coordinates", 
                                            JsTupleGen.of(JsBigDecGen.biased(LAT_MIN, LAT_MAX),
                                                          JsBigDecGen.biased(LON_MIN, LON_MAX)
                                                         ),
                                            "city", JsStrGen.biased(0, MAX_CITY_LENGTH),
                                            "tags", JsArrayGen.biased(JsStrGen.biased(0, 
                                                                                      MAX_TAG_LENGTH
                                                                                     ),
                                                                      0,
                                                                      MAX_TAGS_SIZE
                                                                     ),
                                            "zipCode", JsStrGen.biased(0, MAX_ZIPCODE_LENGTH)
                                            )
                                         .setOptionals("tags", "zipCode", "city"),
                                MIN_ADDRESSES_SIZE, 
                                MAX_ADDRESSES_SIZE        
                                )
              )
           .setOptionals("surname", "phoneNumber", "addresses");

```


Most generators have two static factory methods: _biased_ and _arbitrary_. The latter returns
a uniform distribution of values, whereas the former generates, with a higher probability, 
potential problematic values that tend to cause bugs in our code. For example:

* Integer generator

```java 
    
import fun.gen.Gen;    
    
Gen<JsStr> gen = JsIntGen.biased();

``` 
It produces with higher probability the values:
    
-  Integer.MAX_VALUE
-  Integer.MIN_VALUE
-  Short.MAX_VALUE
-  Short.MIN_VALUE 
-  Byte.MAX_VALUE 
-  Byte.MIN_VALUE 
-  0

We can specify an interval
    
```java    

Gen<JsStr> gen = JsIntGen.biased(min, max)

``` 

that produces with higher probability the bounds of the interval *min* and *max*, and all the 
previoues values from the unbounded generator that fall between the interval.

* Long generator

```java    
    
Gen<JsLong> unbounded = JsLongGen.biased();

Gen<JsLong> bounded = JsLongGen.biased(min, max);
    
``` 

Same values as the integer generators plus *Long.MAX_VALUE* and *Long.MIN_VALUE*

* String generator

```java    
    
Geb<JsStr> gen = JsStrGen.biased(min, max);
    
``` 
produces with higher probability the blank string of length *min* and *max*

If the predefined static factory methods doesn't suit your needs, you
can always create a new generator from the more general primitive types generators
and the function map or just using some combinator:

```java  
import fun.gen.Gen;
import fun.gen.Combinators;
import jsonvalues.gen.JsCons;

//notice it's a String generator
Gen<String> gen = seed -> () -> seed.nextInt() % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd";

Gen<JsStr> parity = gen.map(JsStr::of);

//using the oneOf combinator

Gen<JsStr> parity = Combinators.oneOf("even",
                                      "odd"
                                     )
                               .map(JsStr::of);
                                                          
```

You can combine any number of generators and set the probability of selecting each of them
for the next value generation:    

```java 
// 20% alphaumeric strings and 80% digits
Gen<JsStr> gen = Combinators.freq(new Pair<>(2, JsStrGen.alphanumeric(0, 10)),
                                  new Pair<>(8, JsStrGen.digits(0,10)));
                                 
// 30% long  and 70% integers                                  
Gen<JsValue> gen = Combinators.freq(new Pair<>(3, JsLongGen.biased()),
                                    new Pair<>(7, JsIntGen.biased()));                                

```


Go to the javadoc to get more details about every generator. json-values
generators are built on top of the generators of java-fun.




Let's take a look at some very common transformations using the _map_ functions.
The map function doesn't change the structure of the Json. This is a pattern
known in FP as a functor. Consider the following signatures:

```java   

JsObj mapAllValues( Function<JsPrimitive, JsValue> map) 
JsObj mapAllKeys( Function<String, String> map) 
JsObj mapAllObjs( Function<? super JsObj, JsValue> map)

```

All of them traverse recursively the whole Json. 

The mapAllKeys function transform all the keys of Json objects. The typical example
is when you want to pass from camel case format to snake case. 

The _mapAllValues_ function operates on primitive types (not object or arrays) 
and transform them into any possible value. 


You can access the full path of every mapped value using the following overloaded 
methods:

```java  

JsObj mapAllKeys( BiFunction<JsPath, JsValue, String> map) 
JsObj mapAllValues( BiFunction<JsPath, JsPrimitive, JsValue> map)
JsObj mapAllObjs( BiFunction<JsPath, JsObj, JsValue> map)

```

**json-values** fits well in _pure_ OOP and incredibly well in FP, but NOT in _EOOP_, which stands for
Enterprise Object-Oriented Programming. Don't create yet another fancy abstraction with getters and setters
or a complex DSL over json-values. [Narcissistic Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEZv-kQUSi4) from **Stuart
Halloway** is a
great talk that elaborates ironically on this point.

## <a name="requirements"><a/> Requirements

“Ideas are like rabbits. You get a couple and learn how to handle them, and pretty soon you have a dozen.” – John

After the development of json-values, I published two more related projects:

* The Scala version: [json-scala-values](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/json-scala-values)
* [vertx-effect](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/vertx-effect)
* [mongo-values](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/mongo-values) Set of codecs to use json-values with MongoDB
* [JIO](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/JIO)


json-values uses the persistent data structures from [vavr](https://www.vavr.io/), 
[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) to parse a string/bytes into
a stream of tokens and [dsl-sjon](https://github.com/ngs-doo/dsl-json) to parse a string/bytes given a spec.

## <a name="release"><a/> Release process

Every time a tagged commit is pushed into master, a Travis CI build will be triggered automatically and start the
release process,
deploying to Maven repositories and GitHub Releases. See the Travis conf file .travis.yml for
further details. On the other hand, the master branch is read-only, and all the commits should be pushed to
master through pull requests.
