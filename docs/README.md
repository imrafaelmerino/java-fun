## <a name="introduction"><a/> Introduction
Welcome to **json-values**, the first-ever Json library in _Java_ that uses _persistent data structures_ 
from _Scala_. _Java_ doesn't implement _persistent data structures_ natively; nevertheless, _Scala_ does and 
runs on the _JVM_; therefore, you can go from Java to Scala smoothly and without any impact on the performance. 

I'm a big fan of [Clojure](https://clojure.org) among other functional languages, and with due respect to the
apparent differences, **json-values** follows its philosophy: 

* **Immutability over mutability**. If you still have doubts about why, you should take 
a look at one of my favorite talks ever, [_The value of values_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM) 
from **Rich Hickey**. **json-values** is _functional_ because you can take advantage of immutable data structures 
to represent a Json.
* **Data over abstraction**. The API is declarative and data-centric. You only need values (also known as immutable objects) and functions to 
manipulate them.
* _It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures_. â€”Alan Perlis. 

**json-values** has taken a lot of inspiration from Scala as well, as a matter of fact, it's been implemented following both the object oriented
and functional paradigms, as Scala promotes. By the way, at this moment I'm working on implementing **json-values** in Scala, and it's
being a delightful and enriching experience.
## <a name="whatfor"><a/> What to use json-values for and when to use it
* You need to deal with Jsons, and you want to program following a functional style, **using functions and immutable types (or values)** 
but you can't benefit from all the advantages that immutability brings to your code because **Java doesn't provide Persistent Data Structures**.
The thing is that Java 8 brought functions, lambdas, lazy evaluation to some extent, streams... but, without immutability, 
something is still missing, and as _**Pat Helland**_ said, [Immutability Changes Everything!](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf)
* You manipulate Jsons all the time and you'd like to do it with less ceremony and with spending no time googleling the solution because the library/framework
you are using is to complex. **json-values** is declarative and takes advantages of all the new features that were introduced 
in Java 8, like functions, suppliers, streams and collectors, making json manipulation simple, fast and efficient. 
* You may be thinking, ok, great, I agree with all the described above, but, there are some scenarios where I still need a mutable Json as, after all, I'm programming in Java. 
With **json-values**, you can go from a mutable Json to an immutable one, back and forth, and the API to manipulate 
them is exactly the same, being both implementations hidden to the user. 
* Simplicity matters and I 'd argue that **json-values** is simple.
## <a name="notwhatfor"><a/> When not to use it
**json-values** fits well in _pure_ OOP and incredibly well in FP, but NOT in _EOOP_, which stands for Enterprise Object Oriented Programming. So, don't
create yet another fancy abstraction with a bunch of getters and setters or a complex DSL over the API. [Narcissistic Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEZv-kQUSi4) from **Stuart Halloway** is a 
great talk that elaborates ironically on this point.
## <a name="requirements"><a/> Requirements
Java 8 or greater.
## <a name="installation"><a/> Installation
Add the following dependency to your building tool:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.imrafaelmerino</groupId>
  <artifactId>json-values</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.5</version>
</dependency>
```
and that's all. It's a **zero-dependency** library, so you won't have to go through a kind of dependency hell to get it working. 
You can play around with the library using the java _REPL_ (>= Java 9) just typing:
```
jshell --class-path ${PATH_TO_JAR}/json-values-X.Y.Z.jar
```
